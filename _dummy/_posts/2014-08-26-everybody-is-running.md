I run.

Because, I love to run.

During one of the runs, I realize that everybody is running a race.

Not on track, not on road, but in their lives.

Running is the best art that we mastered over millions of years.

Running to reach there first. Is it worth reaching ?

There is too much noise in our head and in the environment. 100 years back, probably human life had less noise.
