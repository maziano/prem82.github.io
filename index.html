<h1>Hi, I'm Premkumar Masilamani</h1>
</div>  

<p>I love to run, lift weights, think, write, read, question, learn, travel, meet new people, repeatedly challenge myself on various aspects of living, become a guinea pig for my own experiments and indulge in monologues/debates when I have nothing else to do.</p>

<p>This blog summarizes everything that I am. This blog details some of my experiences, experiments and thought processes which may help you to live a better life. So, Go ahead. Dive In.</p>
