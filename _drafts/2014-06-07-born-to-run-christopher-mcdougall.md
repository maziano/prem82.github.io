I read many books which inspired me to such an extent that changed my life forever, for good. This book happened in reverse order. I became a barefoot runner, felt immediate improvements on my knee pain, started researching more about barefoot running, got hold of this amazing book, [Born to Run](http://www.flipkart.com/born-run-christopher-mcdougall-english-profile-books-paperback/p/itmdymamwpv5ux4u?pid=9781861978776&affid=INPremkblo) by Christopher McDougall. Now, I am 100% convinced and happy with the decision of becoming a barefoot runner. Thank you Christopher !!!  

I actually expected a how-to book of barefoot running. A typical book filled with scientific facts, research results, pros & cons etc. But, this book is different. It reads like a novel. This is the story of a mans quest to find the perfect way to run injury free - Our author Christopher McDougall. On his extra-ordinary quest, he finds the Taraumara Tribes, who runs for fun in the deep Canyons in the border of Mexico.
